# VAE
Variational Autoencoder
This repository is edited from https://jmetzen.github.io/2015-11-27/vae.html with few modifications.\
Usage:
```
python vae.py --input_dir data --mode 0
# mode 0 --- mlp
# mode 1 --- conv
```
Little data is provided for testing purpose.\
Training for convolutional VAE appears to be difficult. To be improved.
